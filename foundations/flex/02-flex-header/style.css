/* Why everything works so far, probably 
Discovered there were many things I added that were unnecessary, so I changed things accordingly and - hopefully - learned more with this.

Flex value when omitted is "flex: 0 1 auto"
I learned there is no need to add a value to "flex-grow" in this situation, so the items won't grow any larger.
There's no need to change "flex-shrink" because the elements should shrink if necessary
The most important thing here is "flex-basis", which is by default "auto", which means it should use the whole space available inside the container (.header). GOOD!

Most importantly, we need to add "justify-content: space-between" to the .header because then it spaces out evenly our sections of < right / middle / left >

And then, add "display: flex" once again to the <ul> so their elements will also flex.

To smooth things out, remove padding and add margin from <ul>. Also add "align-items:center" to .header so everything stays leveled in the middle */
